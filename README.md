# Chicode Worksheets

Worksheets used by Chicode at educational events.

## Editing

If you have pug globally installed, then you're good, otherwise either:

- Install it globally

Or

- Run `yarn` in this directory.

Then, run `yarn watch` and the html files in `build/` will automatically be
updated when you edit the pug files in `worksheets/`.
